This script checks your internet speed at: https://www.speedtest.net/ and then signs in Twitter and tweets at your internet provider complaining why your internet speed doesn't match their promised speed.

What I used:

1- Selenium webdriver to scrape the data from https://www.speedtest.net/ and then tweet on Twitter.

2- time module to provide a delay.

3- os module to create environment variables for my email and password.
